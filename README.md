## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Datasets - CVUSA & CVACT
We use two existing dataset to do the experiments

  CVUSA: sampled across the US, ground-level panoramas and corresponding satellite images.
         The dataset can be accessed from https://github.com/viibridges/crossnet

  CVACT: sampled across Australia, ground-level panoramas and corresponding satellite images.
         The dataset can be accessed from https://github.com/Liumouliu/OriCNN

#### Data Preparation
We use limited-FOV panorama crops - emulating a vehicle mounted front-facing monocular camera. To achieve this - the data can be preprocessed before evaluation by running the script:
```
python run.....
```

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### Image Retrieval on CVUSA & CVACT

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |
